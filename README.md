# Product Review ETL Pipeline

This project simulates a real-world ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process for collecting, cleaning, matching, and storing product review data.  
It is based on my experience during a previous internship, reimplemented here for demonstration purposes.

## üîÑ Pipeline Overview

1. **Collect**:  
   - REST API (paginated GET requests with variable URL param)  
   - Selenium + BeautifulSoup fallback when API outdated

2. **Clean**:  
   - Deduplicate by exact match on review text  
   - Liberal filtering, minimal normalization

3. **Match**:  
   - Fuzzy matching + regex between scraped product names and internal reference list

4. **Store**:  
   - Store into MySQL using `pymysql`, with dynamic table naming (`table_name_YYYYMMDD`)
